When you are not sure about whether a research direction is good or not, you can check the quality of the <u>related works</u>. 
---
> (1) Whether the related works have solid definition of the problem?
> 
> (2) Whether the related works have clear motivation? (Whether useful in downstream tasks?)
> 
> (3) Whether the benchmarks (datasets, metrics) used in related works are open-source and clearly-established? 
> 
> (4) Whether the related works have comprehensive and solid evaluation?
