# What is one iteration of MCTS?

One iteration of MCTS consists of four main steps:
1. **Selection**: Starting from the root node, use a tree policy to select a path down the tree to a leaf node. This path is chosen based on the statistics stored in the nodes, balancing exploration and exploitation.
2. **Expansion**: If the selected leaf node has unvisited children (i.e., states reachable via actions not yet explored), choose one of these children to expand the tree.
3. **Simulation**: Starting from the newly expanded child node, simulate a rollout (or playout) of the game (or decision problem) until a terminal state is reached. This simulation typically involves selecting actions randomly or using a simple heuristic.
4. **Backpropagation**: Update the statistics in the nodes along the path from the root to the simulated terminal state based on the outcome of the simulation. This involves incrementing visit counts and updating average payoffs to reflect the results of the rollout.

# How is the tree initialized in MCTS? Does it start with a single root node?

In MCTS, the tree is initialized with a single root node representing the current state of the game or decision problem. This root node has no parent and is considered the starting point for the search. As the search progresses through iterations, the tree grows dynamically by adding new nodes and edges to represent the exploration of the state space.
