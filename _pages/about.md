#### About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. Peng Gao. I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University. My research mainly focuses on the application and customization of LLMs into knowledge-intensive and complex applications in security and software engineering. The following are some projects that I am currently working on:


- `Security of task-specific fine-tuned LLMs` - Investige the security and privacy risks of deploying task-specific fine-tuned LLMs in production, and develop secure serving mechanisms to protect the model and data.
- `LLM knowledge conflict` - Investigate how LLMs choose between inherent knowledge and retrieved content in conflicting scenarios, and develope strategies to help LLMs prioritize and integrate new knowledge effectively for accurate and up-to-date responses.
- `Multi-modal embeddings algorithm` - Explore better ways to integrate multi-modal information into LLMs, and develop algorithms to learn embeddings that capture the complex relationships between different modalities.
