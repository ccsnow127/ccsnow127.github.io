#### About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. Peng Gao. Previously, I was a reseach assistant at the Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, advised by Prof. Pinjia He. I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University.

I am broadly interested in large language model, security and software engineering. My research mainly focuses on the application and customization of LLMs into knowledge-intensive and complex applications in security and software engineering (e.g., CTI analysis, SOC automation, penetration testing, etc.). The following are some projects that I am currently working on:

- `Cyber threat intelligence` extraction and security knowledge graph construction framework empowered by LLMs.
  * Under revision

- `Automatic penetration testing` framework incoporating multiple knowledge-augmented LLM-based agents with memory and learning mechanism. Also a benchmark environment for systematically evaluating the performance of pentest agents.
  * Under development and <u>seeking cooperation</u>, drop me a message if you are interested!

- `Cloud SOC automation` framework built upon domain-data finetuned LLMs.
  * Under development, ETC: 3/2025
